In my TEC REDSHIFT HOMEBREW program, I made two main functions. The first one 
("PAD") tests if one of the pad sections in held down, and if so, it will jump
to another corresponding function that will move the 'x' 1 pixel right, 
left, down or up depending on which part of the pad is held down. The 
second function ("FASTER") does the same thing as "PAD" but instead of just 
moving one pixel at a time, the 'x' moves 3 pixels at a time. This "FASTER"
loop is initated when the player holds down the x botton for 3 seconds.
